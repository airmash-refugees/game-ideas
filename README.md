# AIRMASH Suggestions Repo

There have been a lot of ideas thrown about for new game 
modes/default game improvements and other changes to
AIRMASH in chat. Unfortunately, without anyone writing them
down those ideas are usually forgotten. This repo is meant to
be a place to record these ideas.

## Adding a Suggestion and/or Idea

Want to suggest something? Great! Just create an issue on this github
repo describing your idea so that everyone can see it!
